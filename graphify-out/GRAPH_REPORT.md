# Graph Report - websites  (2026-07-22)

## Corpus Check
- 12 files · ~10,981 words
- Verdict: corpus is large enough that graph structure adds value.

## Summary
- 64 nodes · 53 edges · 13 communities (8 shown, 5 thin omitted)
- Extraction: 100% EXTRACTED · 0% INFERRED · 0% AMBIGUOUS
- Token cost: 0 input · 0 output

## Graph Freshness
- Built from commit: `f713cd98`
- Run `git rev-parse HEAD` and compare to check if the graph is stale.
- Run `graphify update .` after code changes (no API cost).

## Community Hubs (Navigation)
- What You Must Do When Invoked
- /graphify
- graphify reference: extra exports and benchmark
- graphify reference: query, path, explain
- graphify reference: add a URL and watch a folder
- graphify reference: commit hook and native CLAUDE.md integration
- graphify reference: incremental update and cluster-only
- Step 3 - Extract entities and relationships
- graphify reference: GitHub clone and cross-repo merge
- graphify reference: transcribe video and audio
- CLAUDE.md
- .claude/CLAUDE.md
- extraction-spec.md

## Knowledge Gaps
- **43 isolated node(s):** `graphify`, `Usage`, `What graphify is for`, `Step 0 - GitHub repos and multi-path merge (only if a URL or several paths)`, `Step 1 - Ensure graphify is installed` (+38 more)
  These have ≤1 connection - possible missing edges or undocumented components.
- **5 thin communities (<3 nodes) omitted from report** — run `graphify query` to explore isolated nodes.

## Suggested Questions
_Questions this graph is uniquely positioned to answer:_

- **Why does `What You Must Do When Invoked` connect `What You Must Do When Invoked` to `/graphify`, `Step 3 - Extract entities and relationships`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.115) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `/graphify` connect `/graphify` to `What You Must Do When Invoked`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.088) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `Step 3 - Extract entities and relationships` connect `Step 3 - Extract entities and relationships` to `What You Must Do When Invoked`?**
